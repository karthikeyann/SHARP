TOGGLE ALL, ON ALL, OFF ALL in ESP8266
Ready signal from Arduino to ESP
ping signal from ESP and ACK from Arduino. (wait and retry 3 times, then report Arduino non reponsive).
Command execute and acknowlege on response.
Sniff what ESP is continuously talking with Arduino. (power wastage?).


ESP:
ping for ESP.
Diagnostics code. (ping to Arduino, check all status of Relays.).
If Arduino does not ack on commands, ping and then ack in MQTT.
Websocket code.
Reset Arduino by ESP - use GPIO. (find default value on powerup of ESP).


Android code:
Diagnostics run.
Get status of all relays.
See full log on MQTT channel.
Websocket code.


Circuit:
Fix loose connections in AC 12V connection to board.
May be a flat new female connector.
LDR solder.

For relay optocoupler separation!!!
100K + optocoupler for 240V detection?!!!
Double optocoupler separation for 240V to DC12V(Relay) to DC5V(MCU)!!!?
